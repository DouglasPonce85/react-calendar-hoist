**I'm a big "Old School" Transformer's Fan**. So probably at this point you may wondered...

| QUESTION | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Why named it Hoist?   | So here it goes as interesting for this character. If Ratchet is the Autobots' chief surgeon, then Hoist is their family doctor. Everyone reports to Hoist for routine check-ups and maintenance, no exceptions! A jovial, friendly robot, the up-beat Hoist enjoys his job and it shows. He speaks with a cultured British-sounding accent and can usually be found playing "Dr. Watson" to his friend Grapple's troubled artist in his off-hours. |
